# Relational Database Design
A table is a *normalised table* if it conforms to the following restrictions...
* Ordering of rows is not significant
* ordering of columns is not significant
* each row/column intersection contains a single value. Multiple values are not allowed
* Each row in a table must be distinct: row can always be uniquely identified by quoting an appropriate combination of attribute values
