# Introducing the Expr Datatype

## The datatype
<code>

    data Expr
    = Val Double
    | Add Expr Expr
    | Mul Expr Expr
    | Sub Expr Expr
    | Dvd Expr Expr
    | Var Id
    deriving Show -- makes it possible to see values 
    type Id = String

</code>
(10 + 5) ∗ 90 becomes

Mul (Add (Val 10) (Val 5)) (Val 90)

10 + (5 ∗ 90) becomes

Add (Val 10) (Mul (Val 5) (Val 90))

## An evaluator
We can write a function to calculate the result of these
expressions:
<code>

    eval :: Expr -> Double
    eval (Val x) = x
    eval (Add x y) = eval x + eval y
    eval (Mul x y) = eval x * eval y 
    eval (Sub x y) = eval x - eval y
    eval (Div x y) = eval x / eval y

</code>

> eval (Add (Val 10) (Mul (Val 5) (Val 90)))
460.0

## A simplifier 
We can write a function to simplify expressions:

<code>

    simp :: Expr -> Expr
    simp (Val x) = (Val x)
    -- we can use pattern matching in let-expressions!
    simp (Add e1 e2)
        = let e1’ = simp e1
            e2’ = simp e2
    in case (e1’,e2’) of
        (Val 0.0,e) -> e
        (e,Val 0.0) -> e
        _ -> Add e1’ e2’
    simp (Mul e1 e2) = ... -- similar (and Sub,Dvd)
    simp e = e -- catches all remaining cases (Val, Var)
</code>

> simp (Add (Val 10) (Mul (Val 5) (Val 90)))
Val 460.0

## Lookup Dict 
With the Var in the expr datatype ,we can’t fully evaluate these without some way of knowing what
values any of the variables (Var) have.
We can imagine that eval should have a signature like this:

<code>eval :: Dict Id Double -> Expr -> Double</code>

It now has a new (first) argument, a Dict that associates Double(datum values) with Id (key values).

### How to model a lookup Dictionary?
A dict maps keys to datum values.
* An obvious approach is to use a list of key/datum pairs:
  
    type Dict k d = [ (k, d) ]
*  Defining a link between key and datum is simply cons-ing such a pair onto the start of the list.
  
    define :: Dict k d -> k -> d -> Dict k d

    define d s v = (s,v):d
* Lookup simply searches along the list:
  
    find :: Eq k => Dict k d -> k -> Maybe d

    find [] _ = Nothing

   
      find ( (s,v) : ds ) name | name == s = Just v

                             | otherwise = find 

                             ds name

We need to handle the case when the key is not present. This is the role of the Maybe type.

### Maybe Prelude
<code>

    data Maybe a
    = Nothing
    | Just a
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show)
    maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
    maybe n f Nothing = n
    maybe n f (Just x) = f x

    import Data.Maybe -- need to explicitly import this
    isJust :: Maybe a -> Bool
    isJust (Just a) = True
    isJust Nothing = False
    isNothing :: Maybe a -> Bool
    isNothing = not . isJust
    fromJust :: Maybe a -> a
    fromJust (Just a) = a
    fromJust Nothing = error "Maybe.fromJust: Nothing"
    fromMaybe :: a -> Maybe a -> a
    fromMaybe d Nothing = d
    fromMaybe d (Just a) = a
</code>


### Extending the evaluator with Dict 
<code>

    eval :: Dict Id Double -> Expr -> Double
    eval _ (Val x) = x
    eval d (Var i) = fromJust (find d i)
    eval d (Add e1 e2) = eval d e1 + eval d e2
    -- similar for Add, Mul, Dvd
    fromJust (Just a) = a
    --We are back to simpler code (no need for case ... of ...)
</code>

### Pretty Printing

We can write something to print the expression in a more
“friendly” infix style:
<code>

    iprint :: Expr -> String
    iprint (Val x) = show x
    iprint (Var x) = x
    iprint (Dvd x y) = "("++(iprint x)++"/"++iprint y++")"
    -- similar for Add, Mul, Sub
</code>
There are many ways in which this could be made much prettier


## Extending Expr to allow local variable declarations

<code>

    data Expr = Val Double
    | Add Expr Expr
    | Mul Expr Expr
    | Sub Expr Expr
    | Dvd Expr Expr
    | Var Id
    | Def Id Expr Expr
</code>

A sample expression would be...

<code>

    testExpr = Def "a" (Mul (Val 2) (Val 3)) (
    Def "b" (Sub (Val 8) (Val 1)) (
    Sub (Mul (Var "a") (Var "b"))
    (Val 1)))
</code>

### Dict-based Evaluation
For non identifier parts of expressions we simply pass the Dict around but otherwise ignore it.

<code>

    eval :: Dict Id Double -> Expr -> Double
    eval d (Val v) = v
    eval d (Add e1 e2) = (eval d e1) + (eval d e2)
    -- others similarly

    eval d (Var n) = fromJust( find d n) -- look up variable
    eval d (Def x e1 e2= eval(define d x (eval d e1))e2)

    {-evaluate first expression in given dict, add a bindinf from the defined variable to the resulting value, evaluate the second expression with the updated dict
    -}


    fromJust (Just x) = x
</code>


### Using Maybe to handle errors
We can revise our eval function to return a value of type Maybe
Double, using Nothing to signal an error:

<code>

    eval :: Dict -> Expr -> Maybe Double
    eval _ (Val x) = Just x
    eval d (Var i) = find d i -- returns a Maybe type anyway!
</code>

Some other cases...

<code>

    eval d (Mul x y)
    = case (eval d x,eval d y) of
    (Just m,Just n) -> Just (m*n)
    _ -> Nothing
</code>

<code>

    eval d (Dvd x y)
    = case (eval d x, eval d y) of
    (Just m,Just n)
    -> if n==0.0 then Nothing else Just (m/n)
    _ -> Nothing
</code>

<code>

    eval d (Def x e1 e2)
    = case eval d e1 of
    Nothing -> Nothing
    Just v1 -> eval (define d x v1) e2
</code>


**Some Notes....**

* WE can add explicit error handling using Maybe or Either
* Exceptions are available in IO context
* We can do better using higher abstraction and classes


## Higher Order Abstraction 

**Abstraction** is the process of converting expressions into functions.

A typical binary operation case in eval looks like

<code>

    eval d (Sub x y)
    = let r = eval d x ; s = eval d y
    in case (r,s) of
    (Just m,Just n) -> Just (m-n)
    _ -> Nothing
</code>

We just need to process the two sub-expressions, with a binary
operator for the result, so we come up with:

<code>

    evalOp d op x y= let r = eval d x ;
     s = eval d y
    in case (r,s) of
        (Just m,Just n) -> Just (m ‘op‘ n)
        -> Nothing
</code>

The following cases get simplified:

<code>

    eval d (Add x y) = evalOp d (+) x y
    eval d (Mul x y) = evalOp d (*) x y
    eval d (Sub x y) = evalOp d (-) x y
</code>

We can’t do Dvd,
because it will need to return Nothing if y evaluates to 0. At least those operators that cannot raise errors are now easy to code.
