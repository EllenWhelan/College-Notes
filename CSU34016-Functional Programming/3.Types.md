# Types in Haskell
## Datatypes - Chapter 4
Every value has a type. Types are how we group a set of values together that share something in common.
Data declarations are how datatypes are defined.

<code> data Bool = False|True</code>

False and True are data constructors.

### Numeric Types
Integers, Int, Float, Double etc. These all have instances of Num typeclass.

We refer to specific types by their **type constructors** (within data declaration). The data declaration is False|True.

<code>data Bool = False|True</code>

We define types of functions in **type signatures**.

<code>fst :: (a,b) -> a
      snd :: (a,b) -> b </code>

### Tuples
*Tuple* is a type that allows you to store and pass around multiple values within a single value. Values in a tuple do not have to be of same type. Arity in a tuple is set in the type.

<code>

    data (,) a b = (,) a b --datatype declaration for 2 tuple

</code>


<code>

    tupFunc :: (Int, [a])
    -> (Int, [a])
    -> (Int, [a])
    tupFunc (a, b) (c, d) =
    ((a + c), (b ++ d))
</code>

### Lists
Lists are another type used to contain multiple values within a single value. However, they differ from tuples in three important ways: First, all elements of a list must be of the same type. Second, lists have their own distinct [] syntax. Like the tuple syntax, it is used for both the type constructor in type signatures and at the term level to express list values. Third, the number of values that will be in the list isn‚Äôt specified in
the type ‚Äì unlike tuples where the arity is set in the type and immutable.

# Types- Chapter 5

A datatype declaration defines a type constructor and data constructors. Data constructors are the values
of a particular type; they are also functions that let us create data, or values, of a particular type.

### Type signatures
In the form: myFun :: MyInputType -> MyOutputType

<code>

    "julie" :: [Char] -- "julie" has the type String

     True :: Bool -- True has the type Bool
</code>

-> is the type constructor for functions in Haskell

<code> data (->) a b </code>

Type constructor takes args and has no data constructors.

**Type class-constrained type variables**

<code> (+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a </code>

This means the args a must be numeric

* **Type Inference** supported in Haskell meaning we don't have to declare types of functions in advance-compiler figures them out.

* Haskell‚Äôs type system is **polymorphic**, which allows the use of arbitrary types in places where knowing the precise type is not necessary.

* Some Literals have simple pre-determined types.
  
      ‚Äôa‚Äô :: Char
      "ab" :: String‚Äù

* Numeric literals are more complicated
  
      1 :: ?
     Depending on context, 1 could be an integer, or floating point number.

### Atomic Types 
We have some Atomic types builtin to Haskell:

        () the unit type which has only one value, also written as ().


        *Bool* boolean values, of which there are just two: True and False .


        *Ordering* comparison outcomes, with three values: LT, EQ, and GT.


        *Char* character values, representing Unicode characters.


        *Int* fixed-precision integer type 


        *Integer* infinite-precision integer type


        *Float* floating point number of precision at least that of IEEE single-precision


        *Double* floating point number of precision at least that of IEEE double-precision

### Type Checking and Inference
When a type is provided the compiler checks to see that it is consistent with the equations for the function.

<code>notNull :: [Char] -> Int
notNull xs = (length xs) > 0 </code>

The function notNull is valid, but the compiler rejects it. Why?
The compiler knows the types of (>) and length:

<code>length :: [Char] -> Int -- not quite, see later

(>) :: Int -> Int -> Bool -- not quite either </code>

The below would work

<code> notNull :: [Char]->Bool

notNull xs = (length xs) >0
</code>

### Parametric Polymorphism
We can give a generic type to functions

<code> length :: [a] -> Integer </code>

# Type Classes- Chapter 6

Type classes and types in Haskell are, in a sense, opposites. Where a declaration of a type defines how that type in particular is created, a declaration of a type class defines how a set of types are consumed or used in computations.
Type classes allow us to generalize over a set of types in
order to define and execute a standard set of features for those types.

* The declaration Eq a => a -> a -> Bool contains what is
known as a type constraint (here, Eq a =>)
* The constraint says that the type a must belong to the class of types Eq
* A number of predefined type classes:
  * Eq : Defines ==.
(Hint: try :i Eq in GHCi).
  * Num : Defines + and -, among others
  * Ord : Defines comparisons, <=
  * Show : Can convert to String
(think of implementing .toString() in Java).

Mentioning class name is a promise that some set of functions will work on values of that class. A type class is an interface that the compiler will check for you, allowing you to say things like " this function accepts anything that (+) works on"

### Eq Typeclass
this typeclass implements equality in haskell. Eq is defined as follows...

<code>

    class Eq a where

    (==) :: a -> a -> Bool

    (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
</code>

First, it tells us we have a type class called Eq where there are two basic functions, equality and nonequality, and gives their type signatures. Next it lists the instances of Eq:

<code>

    -- partial list
    instance Eq a => Eq [a]
    instance Eq Ordering
    instance Eq Int
    instance Eq Float
    instance Eq Double
    instance Eq Char
    instance Eq Bool
    instance (Eq a, Eq b) => Eq (a, b)
    instance Eq ()
    instance Eq a => Eq (Maybe a)
    instance Eq Integer
</code>

We know from this that any time we are using data of these types, we are implementing the Eq type class and therefore have generic functions we can use to compare their equality. Any type that has an instance of this
type class implements the methods of the type class.

Equality (==) is ad-hoc polymorphic, meaning There has to be a specific (different) implementation of it for
each type. Remember parametric polymorphism of length where code works regardless of underlying element type.

**Type class deriving** Type class instances we can magically derive are Eq, Ord, Enum, Bounded, Read, and Show, though there are some constraints on deriving some of these. Deriving means you don‚Äôt have to manually write instances of these type classes for each new datatype you create.

### Writing typeclass instances 

<code>

    data DayOfWeek =
    Mon | Tue | Weds | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

    -- day of week and numerical day of month
    data Date =
    Date DayOfWeek Int
</code>
<code>

    instance Eq DayOfWeek where
    (==) Mon Mon = True
    (==) Tue Tue = True
    (==) Weds Weds = True
    (==) Thu Thu = True
    (==) Fri Fri = True
    (==) Sat Sat = True
    (==) Sun Sun = True
    (==) _ _ = False

    instance Eq Date where
    (==) (Date weekday dayOfMonth)
    (Date weekday' dayOfMonth') =
    weekday == weekday'
    && dayOfMonth == dayOfMonth'

</code>

**NB** A **partial function** is a function that doesn't handle all possible cases.

### Num Typeclass
<code>

    class Num a where
    (+) :: a -> a -> a
    (*) :: a -> a -> a
    (-) :: a -> a -> a
    negate :: a -> a
    abs :: a -> a
    signum :: a -> a
    fromInteger :: Integer -> a

    instance Num Integer
    instance Num Int
    instance Num Float
    instance Num Double
</code>

The type class called **Integral** ( a subclass of Num) has the following definition:
<code>

    class (Real a, Enum a) => Integral a where
    quot :: a -> a -> a
    rem :: a -> a -> a
    div :: a -> a -> a
    mod :: a -> a -> a
    quotRem :: a -> a -> (a, a)
    divMod :: a -> a -> (a, a)
    toInteger :: a -> Integer
</code>
The type class constraint (Real a, Enum a) => means that any type that implements Integral must already have instances for Real and Enum type classes.

The **Fractional** (subclass of Num) type class is
defined as follows:

<code>

    class (Num a) => Fractional a where
    (/) :: a -> a -> a
    recip :: a -> a
    fromRational :: Rational -> a
</code>

This type class declaration creates a class named Fractional which requires its type argument ùëé to have an instance of Num in order to create an instance of Fractional.

### Ord  Typeclass
This type class covers things that can be ordered. It depends on the eq class. In order to define compare, we have to use ==
  * So, for a type to belong to Ord, it must belong to Eq
  * Think of it as a form of inheritance
  
<code>

    class Eq a => Ord a where
    compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
    (<) :: a -> a -> Bool
    (>=) :: a -> a -> Bool
    (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
    (<=) :: a -> a -> Bool
    max :: a -> a -> a
    min :: a -> a -> a
    compare x y
        |x == y = EQ
        | x <= y =LT
        | otherwise = GT

    instance Ord a => Ord (Maybe a)
    instance (Ord a, Ord b) => Ord (Either a b)
    instance Ord Integer
    instance Ord a => Ord [a]
    instance Ord Ordering
    instance Ord Int
    instance Ord Float
    instance Ord Double
    instance Ord Char
    instance Ord Bool
</code>
We have type class constraint at top a must be eq. Must have Eq instance in order to have Ord instance.

<code>

data DayOfWeek =
Mon | Tue | Weds | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun
deriving (Ord, Show. Eq)
</code>

Ord and Show are derived so they are in scope.

### Enum Typeclass
This type class covers types that are enumerable, therefore have known predecessors and successors.
<code>

    class Enum a where
    succ :: a -> a
    pred :: a -> a
    toEnum :: Int -> a
    fromEnum :: a -> Int
    enumFrom :: a -> [a]
    enumFromThen :: a -> a -> [a]
    enumFromTo :: a -> a -> [a]
    enumFromThenTo :: a -> a -> a -> [a]
    instance Enum Ordering
    instance Enum Integer
    instance Enum Int
    instance Enum Char
    instance Enum Bool
    instance Enum ()
    instance Enum Float
    instance Enum Double
</code> 

### Functor type class

<code>
class Functor f where
fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
</code>

### Show Typeclass
Show is a type class that provides for the creating of human readable string representations of structured data.
<code>

    class Show a where
    showsPrec :: Int -> a -> ShowS
    show :: a -> String
    showList :: [a] -> ShowS
    instance Show a => Show [a]
    instance Show Ordering
    instance Show a => Show (Maybe a)
    instance Show Integer
    instance Show Int
    instance Show Char
    instance Show Bool
    instance Show ()
    instance Show Float
    instance Show Double
</code>

### Instances are dispatched by type
Type classes are dispatched by type, but it‚Äôs an important thing to understand. Type classes are defined by the set of operations and values all instances will provide. Type class instances are unique pairings of the type class and a type. They define the ways to implement the type class methods for that type.
* a type class defines a set of functions and/or values;
* types have instances of that type class;
* the instances specify the ways that type uses the functions of the type class


# Declaring new Types in Haskell 
* Type Synonyms
        type Name = String
Haskell considers both String and Name to be exactly the
same type.
* ‚ÄúWrapped‚Äù Types
        newtype Name = N String
If s is a value of type String, then N s is a value of type Name. Haskell considers String and Name to be different types.
* Algebraic Data Types
        data Name = Official String String | NickName String
If f, s and n are values of type String, then Official f s
and NickName n are different values of type Name

### Type Synonyms
<code>type MyType = ExistingType</code>

Haskell considers both MyType and ExistingType to be exactly the same type.

* Advantages
Clearer code documentation
Can use all existing functions defined for ExistingType
* Disadvantages
Typechecker does not distinguish ExistingType from any
type like MyType defined like this
<code>

type Name = String ; name :: Name ; name = "Andrew"

type Addr = String ; addr :: Addr ; addr = "TCD"

name ++ addr -- is well-typed
</code>


### "Wrapping" Existing Types
<code>newtype NewType = NewCons ExistingType</code>

If v is a value of type ExistingType, then NewCons v is a value of type NewType.
* Advantages
    Typechecker treats NewType and ExistingType as different
    and incompatible.
    Can use type-class system to specify special handling for
    NewType.
    No runtime penalties in time or space !
* Disadvantages
    Needs to have explicit NewCons in front of values
    Need to pattern-match on NewCons v to define functions
    None of the functions defined for ExistingType can be used
    directly

## Algebraic Data Types 
Remember Data and type constructors...
     Type constructors are used only at the type level, in type signatures and type class declarations
     and instances. Types are static and resolve at compile time. Data constructors construct the values at term level, values you can interact with at runtime. We call them constructors because they define a means of creating or building a type or a value. Data is what we work with at runtime


<code>

data ADTName
= Dcon1 Type11 Type12 ... Type1a

| Dcon2 Type21 Type22 ... Type2b

...

| DconN TypeN1 TypeN2 ... TypeNz
</code>

* If vi1, . . . vik are values of types Typei1 . . . Typeik, then Dconi vi1 ... vik is a value of type ADTName,
and values built with different Dconi are always different
* Note that a Dconi can have no Typeij,
in which case Dconi itself is a value of type ADTName

* Advantages
The only way to add genuinely new types to your program
* Disadvantages
    As per newtype ‚Äî the need to use the Dconi
    data-constructors, and to pattern match
    Unlike newtype, these data types do have runtime overheads
    in space and time.

### Data types in Prelude

<code>

data () = () -- Not legal syntax; builtin

data Bool = False | True

data Char = ... ‚Äôa‚Äô | ‚Äôb‚Äô ...

-- Unicode values

data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

data Either a b = Left a | Right b

data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT

data [a] = [] | a : [a]

-- Not legal syntax; builtin


data IO a = ... -- abstract

data (a,b) = (a,b)

data (a,b,c) = (a,b,c)

-- Not legal syntax; builtin

data IOError -- internals system dependent


{- Standard numeric types.
The data declarations for these types cannot be expressed directly
in Haskell since the constructor lists would be far too large.-}

data Integer = ... -1 | 0 | 1 ...

*A failure example*

We can write functions such as head so that they fail outright:

<code>
head (x:xs) = x -- no [] pattern, so runtime fail for head []
</code>

Define type Maybe a to represent a optional value of type a:

<code>
data Maybe a = Nothing
| Just a
</code>

Now we can handle failure for head in a more manageable way:

<code>
mhead :: [a] -> Maybe a
mhead [] = Nothing
mhead (x:xs) = Just x
</code>

This technique is so common that Maybe and some useful
functions are included in the standard Prelude
