# Introduction to lambda calculus (Chapter 1)
Functional programming is a computer programming paradigm
that relies on functions modeled on mathematical functions.
The essence of functional programming is that programs are
a combination of expressions. Expressions include concrete
values, variables, and also functions. Functions have a more specific definition: they are expressions that are applied to an argument or input, and once applied, can be reduced or evaluated.

In functional programming, functions are first class: they can be used as values or passed as arguments to more functions. Haskell is pure functional and therefore abstract. This is why it can produce very concise programs.

**A Function** is a relation between set of inputs and outputs. Functions can be thought of as *mapping a set of inputs to a set of outputs*. 

## Lambda Calculus Basics
There is 3 basic components, or lambda terms: expressions, variables and abstractions.

* expression is super-set of others: can be a variable name, an abstraction, or a combination of those things. The simplest expression is a single variable
* Variable have no meaning or value; they are only names for potential input to functions
* Abstraction is a function: it is a lambda term with a head ( a lambda) and a body and is applied to an argument(input value)

### Abstractions
Abstractions consist of two parts: the head and the body.
The head of the function is a 𝜆 (lambda) followed by a variable
name. The body of the function is another expression. So, a
simple function might look like this:
𝜆x.x

The variable named in the head is the parameter and binds
all instances of that same variable in the body of the function.
That means, when we apply this function to an argument, each
𝑥 in the body of the function will have the value of that argument.
This function has no name and therefore cannot be called by a named function. We don't name it to allow possibility of applying general function to different values.

**Alpha Equivalence**

says that   𝜆𝑥.𝑥
            𝜆𝑑.𝑑
            𝜆𝑧.z
are all the same. in fact these are called identity functions.

**Beta Reduction** 

When we apply a function to an argument, we substitute the
input expression for all instances of bound variables within the body of the abstraction. You also eliminate the head of the abstraction, since its only purpose was to bind a variable. This process is called beta reduction.
We’ll do our first beta reduction using a number.2 We apply the function above to 2, substitute 2 for each bound variable in the body of the function, and eliminate the head:
                (𝜆𝑥.𝑥) 2
                       2
The 𝑥 has no inherent meaning, but, because it
is bound in the head of this function, when the function is applied to an argument, all instances of 𝑥 within the function body must have the same value.

**Free Variables**
The purpose of the head of the function is to tell us which variables to replace when we apply our function, that is, to bind the variables. A bound variable must have the same value throughout the expression.
But sometimes the body expression has variables that are
not named in the head. We call those variables free variables.

In the following expression:

        𝜆𝑥.𝑥y
 y is a free variable and is irreducible.

**Multiple Arguments**
Functions that require multiple arguments have nested heads.

        𝜆𝑥𝑦.𝑥𝑦
is a convenient shorthand for two nested lambdas (one for
each argument, 𝑥 and 𝑦):

        𝜆𝑥.(𝜆𝑦.𝑥𝑦)

1. 𝜆𝑥𝑦.𝑥𝑦
2. (𝜆𝑥𝑦.𝑥𝑦)(𝜆𝑧.𝑎) 1
3. (𝜆𝑥.(𝜆𝑦.𝑥𝑦))(𝜆𝑧.𝑎) 1
4. [𝑥 ∶= (𝜆𝑧.𝑎)] --syntax for binding variable
5. (𝜆𝑦.(𝜆𝑧.𝑎)𝑦) 1
6. [𝑦 ∶= 1]
7. (𝜆𝑧.𝑎) 1 We still can apply this one more time.
8. [𝑧 ∶= 1] But there is no 𝑧 in the body of the function, so
there is nowhere to put a 1. We eliminate the head, and
the final result is
9. 𝑎


 **Evaluation**

 An expression is in Beta normal form when you cannot beta reduce the terms any further (apply lambdas to arguments any further). This is essentially a fully evaluated expression or executed program.

 **Combinators**
 is a lambda term with no free variables, they serve only to combine the arguments they are given.


 **Divergence**
 some terms when they are fully reduced are still not in normal form because they diverge(the reduction process never terminates)

 ## Summary of lambda 
 * Functional programming is based on expressions that include variables or constant values, expressions combined with other expressions, and functions.
 * Functions have a head and a body and are those           expressions that can be applied to arguments and reduced, or evaluated, to a result.
 * Variables may be bound in the function declaration, and
every time a bound variable shows up in a function, it has
the same value.
* All functions take one argument and return one result.
* Functions are a mapping of a set of inputs to a set of
outputs. Given the same input, they always return the
same result.

### Lambda in Haskell 

Since functions are first class entities, we should expect to find some notation in the language to create them from scratch. There are times when it is handy to just write a function “inline”.
The notation is:

                \ x -> e
where x is a variable, and e is an expression that (usually) mentions x. This notation reads as “the function taking x as input and returning e as a result”.

 We can have nested abstractions

                \ x -> \ y -> e
Read as “the function taking x as input and returning a function
that takes y as input and returns e as a result”.
There is syntactic sugar for nested abstractions:

                \ x y -> e

The following definition groups are equivalent:
<code>

sqr = \ n -> n * n

sqr n = n * n

add = \ x y -> x+y

add x = \ y -> x+y

add x y = x+y
</code>

A simple definition of factorial, ignoring negative numbers, is the following:
<code>

fac 0 = 1

fac n = n * fac (n-1)
</code>

But what is fac?

<code>

fac = \n -> case n of

0 -> 1

m -> m * fac (m-1)
</code>


# Introduction to Haskell (Chapter 2)

*From class slides...*

Function definitions written as equations. 

<code>
 double x= x+x

quadruple x = double(double x)</code>

Type polymorphism can be achieved using a.

<code>length:: [a]--> Int </code>

length takes list of arbitrary type a and returns an int.

<code> from n= n : (from(n+1)
</code>

haskell is lazy and doesn't evaluate values until needed so the above won't actually cause a problem.

*From the textbook...*

What is Prelude? Prelude is a library of standard functions.
 
 <code>sayHello :: String -> IO ()

sayHello x =

putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ x ++ "!")</code>

:: is a way to specify the type signature. Here sayhello takes a string and returns an IO action.

Everything in Haskell is an **expression** or **declaration**. **Expressions** may be values, combinations of values, and/or functions applied to values. Expressions evaluate to a result. Regarding **declarations**, it suffices to say for now that they are top-level bindings which allows us to name expressions. We can then use those names to refer to them multiple times without copying and pasting the expressions.
Expressions are in **normal form** when they've reached an irreducible form.

## Functions in Haskell
Functions are specific type of expression (which are most basic unit of Haskell program). As in lambda calculus all haskell functions take one input and have one output. To allow multiple arguments to a function, we apply series of nested functions to each argument (called *currying*)

### Defining Functions
name parameter = body of function

<code>triple x = x*3</code>

Remember function names start with lower case letters

**Infix Operators** 
Operators are functions that can be used in infix style.

**Arithmetic Functions in Haskell**

Operator Name Purpose/application

'+' plus addition

'-' minus subtraction

'*' asterisk multiplication

/ slash fractional division

div divide integral division, round down

mod modulo like ‘rem’, but after modular division

quot quotient integral division, round towards zero

rem remainder remainder after division
