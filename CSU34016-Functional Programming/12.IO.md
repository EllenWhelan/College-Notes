# Datatypes for IO

## File IO Operations

* openFile
  * Input: pathname, opening mode(read/write)
  * effect: modifies filesystem by creating new file
  * Return Value: handle to new file

* hClose
  * Input: file handle
  * effect: closes file indicated by handle, modifying filesystem
  * return value : none

* opening modes: ReadMode, WriteMode, ...

* hPutChar
  * input: file handle, char
  * effect: modifies file by appending char
  * return value: none
* hGetChar
  * input: file handle
  * effect: reads character from file current position, which is then incremented
  * return value: character read

## IO in Haskell
Functions that do IO in Haskell use special abstract datatype IO a

* Type IO a denotes a “value”:
  * whose evaluation produces an I/O side-effect
  * which returns a value of type a when evaluated.
  * such “values” are called “I/O-actions”.
* I/O-actions that don’t return a value have type IO ()
  * Type () is the singleton (a.k.a. “unit”) type
  * It has only one value, also written ()
* I/O-actions are usually invoked using special syntax
(“do-notation”).

## Other IO types
* data IOMode = ReadMode | WriteMode | ...
file opening mode
* type FilePath = String
File Pathname — just a string.
* data Handle = ....
File Handles — pointers to open files
* There are no types to represent file themselves, or the
file-system.
* I/O in Haskell works by hiding references to external data that
is destructively updated.

# Functions that support IO in Haskell
## Composing IO actions

We need way of composing IO actions in safe (single threaded) way.

Seq:

<code>
seqIO :: (IO a) -> (IO b) -> (IO b)

putAB = seqIO ( putChar ’a’ ) ( putChar ’b’ )
</code>

Works better as infix

<code>
(>>) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b

infixl 1 >>

putAB = putChar ’a’ >> putChar ’b’
</code>

Bind:

<code>
bindIO :: (IO a) -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b

(>>=) :: (IO a) -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b

getput = getChar >>= putChar

<!-- I We don’t always want to make use of the result right away –
one neat solution is to use a lambda abstraction: -->

swap2char

= getChar >>=

(\ c1 -> getChar >>=

(\ c2 -> putChar c2 >> putChar c1))
</code>

## Building IO actions

Apart from the four file I/O actions just presented, we have ways to build our own.

<code> return :: a -> IO a </code>

return x is an I/O action that has no side-effect, and simply returns x.

<code> 

  get2str :: IO String

  get2str

  = getChar >>=

  (\ c -> getChar >>=

  (\ d -> return [c,d]))

</code>

### Some syntactic sugar 
We have some syntactic sugar for the >> and >>= functions.

<code>getChar >>= (\ c -> getChar >>= (\ d -> return [c,d])) </code>

We can write a multiline version, dropping brackets, as

<code>

getChar >>= \ c ->

getChar >>= \ d ->

return [c,d]
</code>

We can read this as: “getChar, call it c, getChar, call it d, and return [c,d]”.

### Do-notation
We have some further syntactic sugar 

<code>
do c <- getChar

d <- getChar

return [c,d]
</code>

Restriction: the only way to compose actions is to sequence them

#### Invoking actions in do notation
* If action act a b c returns nothing, we simply call it
act a b c
* If action act a b c returns a value we can either:
  * simply invoke it as is (discarding the return value)
act a b c
  * or invoke it and bind the return value to a variable
x <- act a b c
* The last action in a do-expression cannot bind its return value
actlast a b c

Its return value becomes that of the entire do-expression.


#### Example of IO using do notation


    fCopyChar :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()

    fCopyChar fromf tof

    = do ff <- openFile fromf ReadMode

        c <- hGetChar ff

        hClose ff

        tf <- openFile tof WriteMode

        hPutChar tf c

        hClose tf


Now see it without do notation...

<code>

    fCopyChar fromf tof
    = openFile fromf ReadMode >>= \ ff ->
        hGetChar ff >>= \ c ->
        hClose ff >>
        openFile tof WriteMode >>= \ tf ->
        hPutChar tf c >>
        hClose tf
</code>



# More IO
Functions in IO should be tail recursive.


<code>

    writeWholeFile :: Handle -> String -> IO ()
    writeWholeFile _ [] = return ()
    writeWholeFile h (x:xs) = do
      hPutChar h x
      writeWholeFile h xs


    readWholeFile :: Handle -> IO String
    readWholeFile h = getWholeFile h []


    getWholeFile :: Handle -> String -> IO String
    getWholeFile h cs
    = do eof <- hIsEOF h
      if eof then return $ reverse cs
        else do c <- hGetChar h
          getWholeFile h (c:cs)
</code>

*Shouldn't we escape open IO actions?*

Haskell program built from modules, one of which is main.hs. Main module must contain definition:

  main :: IO ()
  main = do ... -- whatever

When the program starts it evaluates main and there is therefore no need to escape.
