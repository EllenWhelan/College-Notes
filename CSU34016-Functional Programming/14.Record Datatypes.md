# Records in Haskell
A record is really just a standard data type with one constructor:

<code>
data Pair a b = Pair a b </code>

To use a type like this you might provide some “accessor”
functions:

<code>
first :: (Pair a b) -> a

first (Pair a _) = a

second :: (Pair a b) -> b

second (Pair _ b) = b
</code>

We define data type as a record type as a convenience for access.

<code>

    newtype Pair a b = Pair{
                            first :: a,
                            second :: b
                            }
</code>

We can either create values using normal constructor or using named fields.

<code>
f = Pair 1 ’a’

g = Pair { second = ’b’, first = 2 }
</code>

We can look them up using the field names

<code>

    h :: (Pair Int b) -> Int
    h p = (first p) + 1
    --There’s also a convenient syntax for creating a new value based on
    an old one:
    h = g { second = ’B’ }
</code>

> h
Pair 2 ’B’
