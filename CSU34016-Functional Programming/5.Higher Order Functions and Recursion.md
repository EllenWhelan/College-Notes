# More Functions
**Higher Order Function** is a function that accepts functions as arguments.
A function with multiple arguments can be viewed as a function of one argument which computes a new function

**Guards**
basically syntax for if-then-else


## Take, Drop, splitAt
*Take Code*

<code>

    take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
    take n _ | n <= 0 = []
    take _ [] = []
    take n (x:xs) = x : take (n-1) xs
</code>

Let xs1 = take n xs below.

Then xs1 is the first n elements of xs.

If n <= 0 then xs1 = [].

If n >= length xs then xs1 = xs.

*Drop Code*

<code>

    drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
    drop n xs | n <= 0 = xs
    drop _ [] = []
    drop n (x:xs) = drop (n-1) xs
</code>
Let xs2 = drop n xs below.

Then xs2 is xs with the first n elements removed.

If n <= 0 then xs2 = xs.

If n >= length xs then xs2 = [].

*splitAt code*

<code>

    splitAt :: Int -> [a] -> ([a],[a])
    splitAt n xs | n <= 0 = ([],xs)
    splitAt _ [] = ([],[])
    splitAt n (x:xs)
    = let (xs1,xs2) = splitAt (n-1) xs
    in (x:xs1,xs2)
</code>
Let (xs1,xs2) = splitAt n xs below.

Then xs1 is the first n elements of xs.

Then xs2 is xs with the first n elements removed.

If n >= length xs then (xs1,xs2) = (xs,[]).

If n <= 0 then (xs1,xs2) = ([],xs).


# Let, In, Where etc.

## Let 
A let-expression has the form:

        let {d1; . . . ;dn}in e
di are declarations, e is an expression

<code>
let
    x = y + 3
    z = 10
    f a
    = a + 2 * z
in f x
</code>

## Where
A where-expression has the form:

    where {d1; . . . ;dn}
di are declarations

<code>

    solve a b c = ((droot-b)/twoa , negate ((droot+b)/twoa))
    where
        twoa = 2 * a
        discr = b*b - 2 * twoa * c
        droot = sqrt discr

</code>

### Let vs Where 
* The let ...in ... is a full expression and can occur
anywhere an expression is expected.
* The where keyword occurs at certain places in declarations
        . . . where{d1; . . . ;dn}
    of
    * case-expressions [H2010 3.13]
    * modules [H2010 4]
    * classes [H2010 4.3.1]
    * instances [H2010 4.3.2]
    * function and pattern righthand sides (rhs)     
  
* Both allow mutual recursion among the declarations.

## Conditionals
exp → if exp then exp else exp

## Case Expression

A case-expression has the form:
        case e of {p1 -> e1; . . . ;pn -> en}
pi are patterns, ei are expressions.
The offside rule applies.

<code>

    odd x = empty x =

    case (x ‘mod‘ 2) of case x of

    0 -> False [] -> True
    1 -> True _ -> False
    vowel x =
    case x of
    ’a’ -> True
    ’e’ -> True
    ’i’ -> True
    ’o’ -> True
    ’u’ -> True
    _ -> False
