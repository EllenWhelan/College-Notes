# Lists 
Fundamentally lists are built from [] empty list (nullary constructor) and : cons (infix data constructor, short for construct). 

<code>
     data [] a = [] | a : [a]
</code>


* A value of type [t] is either:
    * The empty list, indicated by the (nullary)data constructor [].
    * A non-empty list which is built from a value of type t (v say) and a (pre-existing) value of type[t] (vs say), using the (binary, infix) data constructor (:) (giving (v:vs))
* The two list constructors have the following types (for
arbitrary type a)
        [] :: [a]
        (:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]

## List Syntactic Sugar 
* enumeration [a,b,c,d]
* ranges [4..9]
* comprehension [x*x | x <-[1..10], even x]
* strings are a special notation of lists of characters


## Haskell Prelude
This is a library of functions and datatypes.

## Haskell Prelude- Lists
Haskell prelude contains many useful functions for list 

<code>

    head :: [a] ->a
    head(x:_)= x
    head [] = error "Prelude.head: empty list"

    (++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
    [] ++ ys = ys
    (x:xs) ++ ys = x: (xs ++ ys)

    (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a
    xs !! n | n<0 = error
    [] !! _ = error
    (x:_) !! 0 = x
    (_:xs) !! n = xs !! (n-1)
</code>

Example of using maybe with lists
<code>

    myTail :: [a] -> [a]
    myTail [] = []
    myTail (_ : xs) = xs
</code>

<code>

    data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
    safeTail :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
    safeTail [] = Nothing
    safeTail (_:[]) = Nothing
    safeTail (_:xs) = Just xs
</code>

Example of splitting lists.

<code>
take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]

drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]

splitAt :: Int -> [a] -> ([a], [a])

splitAt _ [] = error 

splitAt n xs = (take n xs, drop n xs)
</code>

**Map function** 
This returns a list constructed by applying a function (a->b) to all items in a list passed in the second argument.

<code>
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
</code>

Example of map in use:

        Input: map reverse ["abc","cda","1234"]
        Output: ["cba","adc","4321"]

**Filter function**
Filtering takes a function that returns a Bool value, maps
that function over a list, and returns a new list of all the values that met the condition. 

<code>

    filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
    filter _ [] = []
    filter pred (x:xs)
    | pred x = x : filter pred xs
    | otherwise = filter pred xs
</code>

**Zip function**
This takes 2 lists adn returns a list of corresponding pairs.

<code>
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]

zip (a:as) (b:bs) = (a,b) : zip as bs

zip _      _      = []
</code>

zipWith generalises zip by zipping with the function given as the first argument, instead of a tupling function. 

<code>

zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]

zipwith f (x:xs) (y:ys) = f x y : zipwith f xs ys

zipwith _ _ _ = []
</code>
