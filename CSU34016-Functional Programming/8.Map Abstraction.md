# Mapping Functions along Lists
Consider a function to increment every number in a list:

<code>

    incAll [] = []
    incAll (n:ns) = (n+1):incAll ns
</code>

or to make a string “shouty” by capitalising everything

<code>

    shouty "" = ""
    shouty (c:cs) = toUpper cs : shouty cs
</code>

They have a common pattern,
which is typically referred to as “mapping”.
* They all have empty list as base case and result
* They all have non empty list as recursive case
* The recursive case applies a function we call f to the head of a list and conses it the result of the recursive call

<code>
< abs-map > [] = u

< abs-map > (a:as) = f a : < abs-map > as
</code>

We must ensure f is a parameter so...

<code>
map f [] = []

map f(a:as) = f a : map f as
</code>

## What type is map?

<code>
map f [] = f

map f (a:as) = f a : map f as

-- a :: t, as :: [t]

-- f :: t -> r -- result type may differ

map :: (t -> r ) -> [t] -> [r]
</code>

This function is also in the Prelude
